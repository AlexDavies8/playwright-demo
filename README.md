For setup:
`npm install`
`npx playwright install`

Install Playwright VSCode extension.
Go to testing tab.
Running all tests in a file works correctly.
Running a single test gives a 'No tests found' error or a warning infobox in the bottom right the test isn't part of the current configuration.

If you run `npx playwright test --ui` you can run individual tests fine via the UI mode.
